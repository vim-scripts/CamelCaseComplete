DESCRIPTION
This plugin offers a keyword completion that is limited to identifiers which
adhere to either CamelCase ("anIdentifier") or underscore_notation
("an_identifier") naming conventions. This often results in a single (or very
few) matches and thus allows quick completion of function, class and variable
names.
The list of completion candidates can be restricted by triggering completion
on all or some of the initial letters of each word fragment; e.g. "vlcn" would
expand to "veryLongClassName" and "verbose_latitude_correction_numeric".
Non-alphabetic keyword characters can be thrown in, too, to both widen the
search to word fragments joined by the keywords (e.g. "joined#words") and to
narrow down the number of CamelCase and underscore_word matches. 

RELATED WORKS								     *

  through CamelCaseWords and underscore_notation and corresponding text
  objects. 
- Loosely based on and similar to the "Custom keyword completion" from
  http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Custom_keyword_completion
- Check out the CompleteHelper.vim plugin page (vimscript #3914) for a full
  list of insert mode completions powered by it.
